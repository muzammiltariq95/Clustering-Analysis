# ✈️ Flight Delay Clustering Analysis

An unsupervised learning project analyzing flight delay patterns across airlines using **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** clustering. The goal was to identify delay trends, regional anomalies, and actionable insights for airline scheduling and resource allocation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project clusters flight delay data to uncover hidden patterns and anomalies in airline operations. Using feature transformation, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised learning, it reveals trends that support smarter route planning and resource distribution.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- **ML Techniques:** K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA
- **Concepts:** Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Feature Scaling, EDA

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment structured delay patterns and flight types  
- Used **DBSCAN** to identify outliers and noise in regional delay data  
- Performed **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and enhance model interpretability  
- Built visualizations to explore flight delay clusters and regional performance

---

## 📊 EDA & Preprocessing

- Cleaned and imputed missing flight delay data  
- Applied standard scaling and correlation filtering  
- Conducted PCA to capture 95% variance in 3 principal components  
- Visualized clusters by delay type, region, and airline

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Python and the required libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
2. Run `clustering_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. View the PCA-reduced cluster plots and insights

---

## 📈 Results

- Segmented flights into 3 major delay behavior clusters
- Detected outlier patterns in specific regions using **DBSCAN**
- Provided actionable recommendations for delay-prone routes
